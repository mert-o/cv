# CV

In this repo, I try and implement my learning outcomes in Computer Vision by using OpenCV and numpy. In some cases, I used plain python to have better understanding of the models.

As I learn more techniques, this repo will also grow in varity of methods used.

### So far including:

  1- Harris Feature Detector

  2- Panoroma Stiching by feature matching
   
  3- General Optical Flow by Lucas-Kanade
